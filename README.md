### Hey there im MyNameBeMrRandom (MrRandom#9258)
Im a (mainly) Python programmer but have been experimenting in other languages such as javascript and soon rust and elixr. ðŸ‘€

My main project at the moment is a discord bot called [Life](https://github.com/iDevision/Life) which im using to help me learn the language.

Im open to discord bot commissions so just shoot me a message on discord over at MrRandom#9258, i have experience with:
  - Music players
  - Tags
  - Todo
  - Info logging
  - Basic web dashboards
  - Databases
I am also willing to learn other things, so if something you need isn't listed here just ask me.
